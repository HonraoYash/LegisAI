(1) In 1987, the United States Supreme Court 
1
ruled in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indi-
2
ans that if California regulated rather than prohib-
3
ited gaming in the State, then a Tribe could offer 
4
similar forms of gaming on its land. 
5
(2) In response to the Cabazon decision, the In-
6
dian Gaming Regulatory Act (Public Law 100–497) 
7
was enacted, which has since supported and pro-
8
moted Tribal economic development and self-suffi-
9
ciency, and continues to provide a regulatory struc-
10
ture for gaming on Tribal lands. 
11
(3) Over 200 Tribes in 28 States are currently 
12
regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
13
(4) On June 15, 2022, the United States Su-
14
preme Court ruled that the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 
15
and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas 
16
Restoration Act (Public Law 100–89; 101 Stat. 
17
666) allows the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and the Ala-
18
bama-Coushatta Tribe to offer gaming activities on 
19
Tribal lands that are not fully prohibited by Texas 
20
law and without regard to any Texas regulations 
21
over such gaming activities.
